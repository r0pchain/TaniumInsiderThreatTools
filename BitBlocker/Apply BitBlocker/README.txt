This is the technique you'll need to use if your environment uses TPM (user NOT prompted for a pass/pin on startup). If your environment requires a PIN/password on boot, please see the "extras" folder. 

You should change the baked-in password of ITPSecurityLockout_1-1A-2B so everyone from Converge isn't using the same value. If you change this to something and the deployment gripes about numeric-only PIN, you'll need to change the password to only be numbers and not letters or special chars.
